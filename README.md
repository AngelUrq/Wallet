### Style guide rules
In general we followed all the rules from the Google Style Guide for Javascript in order to follow good practices
### Rule 1: Max length 150 
```
We change the max length from 50 to 150 because our HTML code has to be longer.
```
### Rule 2: Linebreak-style
```
We removed this rule because we had different configurations for CRLF and LF.
