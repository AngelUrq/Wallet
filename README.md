In general we followed all the rules from the Google Style Guide for Javascript in order to follow good practices
### Rule 1: ES LINT MAX LENGHT 150 
```
We change the max lenght from 50 to 150 because it show warning in templates's code
```
### Rule 2: Linebreak-style: false

We removed this rule because we had different configurations for CRLF and LF
